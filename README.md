# The Barbie Movie Project (Python)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Barbie Movie Adventure!

In this Python project, you will step into the world of Barbieland and complete three programming challenges inspired by key moments in Barbie and Ken’s journey. Each challenge focuses on applying core programming skills including input handling, calculations, formatting output, and logical decision-making.

This assignment also introduces you to using VS Code Tasks to automate setup and testing.

---

## What You Are Required To Do

You must complete the missing code inside `barbie.py`.

There are three challenges:

### 1) Beach Adventure Challenge
You will:
- Prompt the user for input
- Calculate total cost before discounts
- Apply discounts
- Calculate the new total
- Determine each person’s share

### 2) Escape Plan Challenge
You will:
- Calculate time required for three routes
- Determine the fastest route
- Calculate time saved compared to the slowest route

### 3) Societal Reformation Challenge
You will:
- Calculate the success rate of proposed changes
- Determine how many more changes are needed to reach 75%
- Calculate remaining changes

---

## Important Rules

- Do NOT rename the functions.
- Required output lines must match the example formatting exactly.
- Extra print statements are allowed.
- You must push your final code to GitHub.

Example Input and Required Output Formatting

Your program must include output lines formatted exactly like these examples.

**Beach Adventure Challenge**
**Example Inputs:**
```
Number of people: 4
Beach Chairs Cost: $30.00
Sunscreen Cost: $10.00
Ice Cream Cost: $5.00
Beach Toys Cost: $15.00
```
**Required Output Lines:**
**Challenge 1 Results:**
```
Total cost before discounts: $60.00
Total cost after discounts: $53.50
Each person's share: $13.38
```
...................................................
**Escape Plan Challenge
Example Inputs:**
```
Route 1 Distance: 100 miles
Route 1 Speed: 50 mph
Route 2 Distance: 120 miles
Route 2 Speed: 70 mph
Route 3 Distance: 140 miles
Route 3 Speed: 60 mph
```
**Required Output Lines**
**Challenge 2 Results:**
```
Time required for Route 1: 2.00 hours
Time required for Route 2: 1.71 hours
Time required for Route 3: 2.33 hours
The fastest route takes 1.71 hours.
Time saved by choosing the fastest route: 0.62 hours
```
....................................................
**Societal Reformation Challenge**
**Example Inputs:**
```
Total Proposed Changes: 20
Successful Changes: 13
```
**Required Output Lines
Challenge 3 Results:**
```
Percentage of successful changes: 65.00%
Number of additional changes needed to achieve a 75% success rate: 2
Remaining changes to be implemented: 7
```

## Using VS Code Tasks (Required)

This assignment introduces you to using VS Code Tasks to automate common development steps.

We are using the extension:

VSCode Tasks in Sidebar  
Publisher: iulian-radu-at  

If you do not see the Tasks icon in the left sidebar:

1. Open Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
2. Search for: VSCode Tasks in Sidebar
3. Install the extension

---

## How to Run Tasks

1. Click the Tasks icon in the left sidebar.
2. You will see a list of available tasks.
3. Click a task to run it.

You do NOT need to type commands manually.

---

## Tasks (In Order)

### 1) Setup - Create venv (.venv)

Creates a Python virtual environment for this project in a folder named `.venv`.
This keeps your project dependencies isolated from other Python projects.
You typically only need to run this once.

### 2) Setup - Install requirements

Installs the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` into your virtual environment.
For this project, it installs `pytest`, which is used for running public tests.
Run this after creating the virtual environment.

### 3) Run - Program

Runs your `barbie.py` file.
Use this to manually test your program by entering input values.

### 4) Run - Public Tests

Runs the provided public tests located in `tests_public/`.
These tests check that required output lines appear correctly.
Always run this before submitting.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Setup - Create venv (.venv)
2. Setup - Install requirements
3. Run - Program
4. Run - Public Tests
5. Commit and push your code to GitHub

---

## Report (Required)

Write a short report (about half a page) that includes:

- A short description (1–2 sentences) of what the project required
- Challenges you faced while completing it
- Concepts you learned
- Resources or people that helped you

You may submit your report as:
- A text entry  
OR
- An uploaded document  

A PDF is NOT required.

---

## Submission

You must submit:

1) A link to your GitHub assignment repository  
2) Your report  

Make sure your final code has been pushed to GitHub before submitting.

---

## Final Reminder

This assignment introduces:
- Input handling
- Arithmetic calculations
- Conditional logic
- Output formatting
- Virtual environments
- Automated testing with VS Code Tasks

Take your time, test carefully, and make sure your formatting matches the example exactly.
